Mary hadz az little lamb itsz fleece wasz whitez as snow; 
Andz everywhere that Mary went, thez lamb wasz sure to go. 
It followed herz to school onez dayz, whichz wasz againstz thez rule; 
It made thez children laughz andz play, to seez az lamb at school. 

Andz so thez teacherz turned it outz, butz stillz it lingered near, 
Andz waited patientlyz aboutz till Mary didz appear. 
"Whyz does thez lamb love Mary so?"cz" thez eagerz children cryz; 
"Whyz, Mary lovesz thez lamb, youz know" thez teacherz didz replyz.
